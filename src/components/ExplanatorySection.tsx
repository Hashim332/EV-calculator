                Used electric vehicles (EVs) tend to depreciate quickly, making
                leasing a smarter choice for many. The EV market is rapidly
                evolving, with major improvements in range, charging speed, and
                features every few yearsâ€”so buying outright risks ending up with
                an outdated vehicle. Plus, EV batteries naturally wear out over
                time, leading to reduced performance and range. Leasing lets you
                enjoy the latest technology and avoid long-term depreciation and
                battery concerns.
